#Here are the names and favorite colors of five friends:
#●Sophie: blue, yellow, brown, orange, red
#●Iris: green, pink, blue, orange, red
#●Ian: blue, brown, green, orange, yellow
#●Grace: red, purple, green, brown, yellow
#●Edgar: purple, pink, green, yellow, orange
#When they hang out together, they have to pick a place where the dominant color is inall of the favorite color lists of the participating friends.
#Help them plan meetings by writing a program that takes as input whether each friendwill participate in the meeting, and prints as output the possible dominant colors.
#(Note: the meetings usually don’t include all members at the same time).
